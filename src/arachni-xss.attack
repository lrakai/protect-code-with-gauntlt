Feature: Cross-site scripting (xss) using arachni against a URL
  Scenario: Look for xss vulnerabilities and verify no issues are found
    Given "arachni" is installed
      And the following profile:
        | name | value                 |
        | url  | https://www.owasp.org |
    When I launch an "arachni" attack with:
      """
      arachni --checks=xss --scope-page-limit=1 <url>
      """
    Then the output should contain:
      """
      0 issues were detected.
